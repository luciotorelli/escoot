# Epics - User Stories


In the initial phase of developing the E-scoot E-commerce Platform, user stories were created to capture the specific needs and expectations of both buyers and the site owner. Following this, the user stories were organized and grouped into coherent themes and prioritized following the MoSCow method, resulting in the identification of key epics. This separation into epics streamlined the development process by categorizing related functionalities, ensuring a more organized and efficient approach to building the comprehensive features outlined in the user stories below.
